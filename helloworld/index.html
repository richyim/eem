        <h1>EEM Hello World</h1>
        <p>Here is a sample code for EEM for "Hello, World!" program</p>

        <p>This EEM script outputs the text "Hello, World!" when manually triggered. It's a simple example to demonstrate the basics of Cisco's Embedded Event Manager (EEM).</p>

        <!-- EEM Script Explanation -->
        <div class="eem-explanation">
            <h2>EEM Script Explanation:</h2>
            <p><strong>Line 1: event manager applet HelloWorld</strong><br>
            - This line defines the beginning of an EEM applet named "HelloWorld". An applet is a script that is executed in response to a specific event or trigger.</p>
            <p><strong>Line 2: event none</strong><br>
            - This line specifies the event that triggers the execution of the applet. In this case, "none" is used, which means the applet will be executed without any specific event. This essentially makes the applet run immediately upon being created.</p>
            <p>The "event none" configuration allows you to manually trigger the execution of the applet, typically through the use of the "event manager run" command. When the applet is executed, it moves on to the action(s) defined within the applet.</p>
        </div>

            <textarea readonly id="executionResult">RS07#event manager run HelloWorld
Hello, World!</textarea>

            <pre class="code-block" id="codeBlock2">

            </pre>

        <!-- EEM Script Explanation for Second Example -->
        <div class="eem-explanation">
            <h2>EEM Script Explanation for Second Example:</h2>
            <p><strong>Line 1: event manager applet helloworld2 authorization bypass</strong><br>
            - This line begins a new EEM applet named "helloworld2". The "authorization bypass" part indicates that the execution of this applet does not require additional authorization, allowing it to run without adhering to command authorization checks.</p>
            <p><strong>Line 3: action 1.0 syslog msg "Hello World 2"</strong><br>
            - This line defines an action to be taken by the applet, which in this case is to send a message to the logging buffers using the syslog facility. The message to be logged is "Hello World 2".</p>
            <p>In EEM, using "syslog" means that the message is sent to the logging buffers and not directly to the SSH terminal console. To see the syslog messages in the SSH terminal console, you must first issue the "term mon" command. When the "event manager run helloworld2" command is executed, it triggers the syslog message, which is then reflected in the SSH terminal console if "term mon" is enabled.</p>
